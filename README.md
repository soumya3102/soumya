# About Me
# 👋 Hey there, I’m Soumya Jain

**Computer Science Grad ’24 | Delhi Native | Code Explorer**  

I’m on a mission to **learn, break, fix, and repeat** — because that’s how you turn coffee into knowledge.  
Fresh out of college and diving headfirst into experiments with tech, tools, and ideas.  

## 🧠 Current Mood
- Learning as much as my brain’s RAM allows 🖥️
- Trying out new projects just to see if I can
- Debugging life (and code) simultaneously

## 💡 Stuff I Like Playing With
- Code (of course)
- Anything that involves automation
- New frameworks, libraries, and the occasional weird tech rabbit hole

## 📍 Where I’m From
- Born and brewed in **Delhi** 🇮🇳
- Spicy food tolerance: *exceptionally high*

## ⚡ Quick Facts
- **CS Grad (2024)** — so yes, I can still recall the smell of fresh lecture notes  
- I believe *"Hello World"* is the most powerful spell in existence  
- I’m convinced that **trial & error** is just *"research"* in disguise
